# Yet Another Symbolic Differentiation Tool
TODO: Description

# Grammar:
TODO: Add grammar, and add syntax tree for example expression

# Roadmap:
1. After getting known with parsing trees generated with ANTLR4 create class `ExpressionBuilder` for building expressions while traversing tree
2. In future may add eval() function for plotting graphs and maybe general function plot() to plot visualization of given expression
3. Do simple GUI

# Tests
Custom test, e.i. some large expressions etc.
