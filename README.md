# Yet Another Symbolic Differentiation Tool

TODO: Description

# Roadmap:

* Improve printing operators
* Do simple GUI

# Notes:

* Rebuild project:
    - for `Operator` and `Function` implement arithmetic operators, do this for generally working
      i.e `Operator() + Function() -> Add()`
    - generally test each of class, three tests for class, variable as argument, function as argument and operator as
      argument:
        - deriving
        - `__str__` representation
        - simplification
        - flatten if provided
    - make more test
